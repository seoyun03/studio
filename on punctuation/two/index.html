          There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not.
      </div>
      <div class="text text-medium">
          Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing 
          it is completely entirely completely uninteresting.

          It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.

      </div>
      <div class="text text-medium">
          A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark 
          when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing.
      </div>
      <div class="text text-large">
          Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.
