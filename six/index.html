    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence1>You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon or a semi-colon.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence2>There are two different ways of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas</div>
    </div>
      <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence3>and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using them</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence4>can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have,</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence5>I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence6>of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence7>Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character the character that</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence8>a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence9>But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence10>something of the character of the period and so it might have been an adventure to use them.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence11>I really do not think so.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence12>I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence13>and so really I cannot regret not having used them.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence14>They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence15>They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the comma nature.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class=sentence16>And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.</div>
